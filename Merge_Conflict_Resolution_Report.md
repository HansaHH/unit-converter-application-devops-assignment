## Merge Conflict Resolution (DevOps Practice)

During development, an intentional merge conflict was created in `README.md`
to demonstrate Git conflict handling.

### Cause
Two branches modified the same line under **Technologies Used**, specifying
different deployment platforms.

### Resolution
The conflict markers were manually reviewed, and a final unified statement
was selected to accurately reflect the deployment setup.

### Outcome
The conflict was resolved successfully, committed, and merged following
Git best practices.
