## Project Description
A simple unit conversion web application (MERN) that converts between different measurement units (length, temperature, weight, etc.) and records conversion history via a lightweight API.

## Live Deployment
**Live URL:** [.....................]

## Repository
**GitHub:** https://github.com/HansaHH/unit-converter-application-devops-assignment.git

## Technologies Used
- React.js , TailwindCSS
- Node.js (Express)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- [Deployment platform name — e.g., Vercel, Render]

## Features
- Convert between multiple unit types (length, temperature, mass, etc.)
- Stores conversion history on the backend
- REST API for conversion and history

## Branch Strategy
We implemented the following branching strategy:
- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `backend` - Backend development branch

## Setup Instructions
**Prerequisites**
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- Git

**Installation**

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HansaHH/unit-converter-application-devops-assignment.git
```
#### Navigate to project directory
```bash
cd unit-converter-application-devops-assignment/backend
```
#### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
#### Run development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Deployment Process (CI/CD)**
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. A pipeline runs tests/builds on pushes to `develop` and `main`, and automatically deploys to the configured deployment platform on successful merges to `main`.

## Challenges Faced
[ * Implementing conditional authentication for the translation endpoint.]
[ * Handling CORS issues between the Vite dev server and the Express backend.]
[ * Configuring Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS in a MERN environment.]
